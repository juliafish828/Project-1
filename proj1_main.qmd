Data is everywhere. It's power is immeasurable with finding patterns, modeling relationships, and driving decisions. In order to be able to do that, data must be handled appropriately.  In this report, we will go through the motions of loading in and preprocessing some data so that it's true power can be used as discussed above.


## Question 1: Selecting Columns

First, we will load in the appropriate data set and select only `area_name`, `STCOU`, and any columns that end with the letter D.

```{r}
sec1 <- read_csv("./data/EDU01a.csv", col_names = TRUE)

sec1_new <- sec1 |>
  select(area_name = Area_name,
         STCOU,
         ends_with("D"))

head(sec1_new, n = 5)
```

The selected columns look to be what we hoped.
